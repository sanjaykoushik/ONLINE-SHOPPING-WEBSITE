<h1>BOOKS</h1>
<p>
In the world of device...you wants a device...Books! 
The best friend in the world.
</p>
<p>

The joy of reading books can't be described in words. 
It's something that you understand only by real experience.
</p>
<p>
Books are our best friends, guides and philosophers. 
Books uphold and encourage us when we feel sad and despondent. 
They bring light into darkness and sunshine into shadow.
</p>
<p>
When you read a book, its feels great to put yourself into a world the writer has created for you.
The habit of reading good content daily will act like an exercise for your mind and keep you mentally fit and flexible. 
Reading a book is not like that you read a book in English,that is in any language which you feel comfortable. 
If you have never given it a try then always remember that it's never too late to start a good habit.
</p>
<p>
<h4>
Books help our mind soar. They even feel like friends when real ones let you down.
</h4>
</p>
<p>
Books available at our store are TE and BE reference books.
Cost of whole set of TE and BE books is Rs.400 each.
